                <p>Hello, I'm glad to receive you in my personal portfolio website!</p>

                <p>I'm passionate for computing since my childhood. I had my first computer around 13 years old, without internet I explored the whole windows 7, the pre-installed softwares and a lot of cd games.</p>

                <img src="" alt="">
                <p>I really delayed to notice the Foreign Trade was "not for me". I give it a try several times, but I reach a point that I questioned myself "what I'm doing and why?"</p>

                <img src="" alt="">
                <p>Is not about money, Foreign Trade pay very well, it's the will to do a rewarding thing not just "send this e-mail or put this there"</p>
            </div>
            <div class="box">
                <img src="" alt="">
                <p>No, I'm not thinking to change the world or save it. I just want to make a thing which is relevant for my at least, but if was for anyone either, great!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="box">
                <img src="" alt="">
